The Neera Banters - Version 0.1.2-20150101



Do you wish Neera would interact more with her companions in BGEE?  Then this mod is for you!  The Neera Banters adds banters for Neera and several of the joinable NPCs.

It is my intention to give Neera at least 1 banter with all of the joinable NPCs available in vanilla BGEE.  For now, only a small subset are available.

Banters are currently available with Branwen, Coran, Dynaheir, Faldorn, Imoen, Jaheira, Khalid, Minsc, Montaron, Xan, and Xzar.  More will be added in future releases, and content suggestions are welcome!




INSTALLATION

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be an neerabanters folder and a setup-neerabanters.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-neerabanters.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-neerabanters.exe  in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
If properly extracted, you should have a neerabanters folder, setup-neerabanters, and setup-neerabanters.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bneerabanters.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy weidu, weinstall, and tolower to /usr/bin. Then, open a terminal, cd to your BGEE installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. Run 'weinstall setup-neerabanters' in your game folder to install the mod.

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please contact me at the BGEE Forums (http://forum.baldursgate.com/).


COMPATIBILITY

The Neera Banters Mod is coded using WeiDU and does not overwrite any files. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods.
